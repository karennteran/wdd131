The navigation is clear and intuitive, allowing visitors to easily move between sections. This pafe also highlights key features, such as dynamic expense tracking and savings goal calculator, to encourage users to explore further.The budget tracker page is the core functionality of the project. Users can input their income and expenses into a form, specifying details like category, description, and amount.
